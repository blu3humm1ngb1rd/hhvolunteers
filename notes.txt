NON OPTIONAL CRUD

volunteers should be able to:
- CREATE - sign up for a project (volunteer_project creation)
- READ - see which projects they've signed up for (volunteer has_many projects through volunteer_projects)
- UPDATE - update number of hours on a project (or role or something else) - NOT the project itself
- DESTROY - remove a signup so they aren't volunteering for a project anymore - NOT delete projects

authorization
 - can't sign up or remove other volunteers from projects
 - can't edit hours/role/whatever on someone else's volunteer_project
 

 restful conventions to follow

 get '/projects' should show all projects
 get '/projects/:id' should show one project and its info. optionally, list all the volunteers associated
 get '/volunteers/:id' should show info for one volunteer. show list of projects associated with that volunteer
 to volunteer you probably see a form on the project show page (get '/projects/:id')
 that form would have an action '/volunteer_projects' with method "post"
 at that route you create a volunteer_project with that current_user id and project id
 redirect to the volunteer show page, or redirect to '/volunteer_projects/:id'
