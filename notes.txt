--------volunteers can edit their own project they made; can NOT edit other's projects

--------volutneer can destroy their own projects, can NOT destroy other's projects 

authorization

 restful conventions to follow

 get '/projects' should show all projects
 get '/projects/:id' should show one project and its info. optionally, list all the volunteers associated
 get '/volunteers/:id' should show info for one volunteer. show list of projects associated with that volunteer
 to volunteer you probably see a form on the project show page (get '/projects/:id')
 that form would have an action '/volunteer_projects' with method "post"
 at that route you create a volunteer_project with that current_user id and project id
 redirect to the volunteer show page, or redirect to '/volunteer_projects/:id'
